Long COVID/PASC is the continuation or development of new symptoms after three months from the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, which lasts for at least two months and has no other identifiable cause. Long COVID/PASC occurs in 10&#8211;20% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The most common symptoms include fatigue, cognitive impairment (brain fog), and shortness of breath. However, more than 200 symptoms have been reported. No phenotypic or diagnostic biomarkers have been identified for developing long COVID/PASC, which is a multisystem disorder that can present with isolated or combined respiratory, hematological, immunological, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. There is no cure. Therefore, individualized patient management requires a multidisciplinary clinical approach. Because millions of people have had and continue to have COVID-19, even in the era of vaccination and antiviral therapies, long COVID/PASC is now and will increasingly become a health and economic burden that the world must prepare for. Almost five years from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, this article aims to review what is currently known about long COVID/PASC, the anticipated increasing global health burden, and why there is still an urgent need to identify diagnostic biomarkers and risk factors to improve prevention and treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Long COVID</kwd><kwd>PASC</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>Biomarkers</kwd><kwd>Risk Factors</kwd><kwd>Review</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC-ND</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as post-COVID-19 condition or post-COVID syndrome, can affect anyone infected with SARS-CoV-2, regardless of age or the severity of the initial symptoms of COVID-19 (<xref rid="t1-medscimonit-30-e946512" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) [<xref rid="b1-medscimonit-30-e946512" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-medscimonit-30-e946512" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

The terminology used for the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection varies, and the terms long COVID, post-COVID syndrome, and post-COVID-19 condition have been considered too simplistic [<xref rid="b4-medscimonit-30-e946512" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b8-medscimonit-30-e946512" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

However, long COVID is still the most commonly used term (<xref rid="t1-medscimonit-30-e946512" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In unvaccinated children and adults, some patients with severe COVID-19 developed an acute &#8216;cytokine storm&#8217; up to four weeks following initial COVID-19, resulting in multiorgan damage due to hypercoagulation and vascular hyperpermeability [<xref rid="b9-medscimonit-30-e946512" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
