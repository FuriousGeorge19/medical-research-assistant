Intermittent fasting (IF) and protein pacing (P) regimens are effective in facilitating weight loss (WL) and enhancing body composition. However, the interrelationships between IF- and P-induced WL and the GM are unknown. The current randomized controlled study describes distinct fecal microbial and plasma metabolomic signatures between combined IF-P (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;21) versus a heart-healthy, calorie-restricted (CR, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;20) diet matched for overall energy intake in free-living human participants (women = 27; men = 14) with overweight/obesity for 8 weeks. Gut symptomatology improves and abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Christensenellaceae</italic> microbes and circulating cytokines and amino acid metabolites favoring fat oxidation increase with IF-P (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05), whereas metabolites associated with a longevity-related metabolic pathway increase with CR (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05). Differences indicate GM and metabolomic factors play a role in WL maintenance and body composition. This novel work provides insight into the GM and metabolomic profile of participants following an IF-P or CR diet and highlights important differences in microbial assembly associated with WL and body composition responsiveness. These data may inform future GM-focused precision nutrition recommendations using larger sample sizes of longer duration.

Dependent on the host for nutrients and fluid, one of the main processes by which the GM affects host physiology is producing bioactive metabolites from the gastrointestinal (GI) contents. Nutrient composition, feeding frequency, and meal timing impact this dependency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. To maintain a stable community and ecosystem, the GM must regulate its growth rate and diversity in response to nutrient availability and population density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Such maintenance is affected by caloric restriction (CR) coupled with periods of feeding and intermittent fasting (IF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, we&#8217;ve recently shown the nutritional composition and meal frequency during these periods alter the metabolizable energy for the host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.

Further, recent preclinical work in mice has identified dietary protein as having anti-obesity effects after CR that are partially modulated through the GM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Thus, the need to examine this in humans is warranted.</p><p id="Par4">In this current work, we compare the effects of two low-calorie dietary interventions matched for weekly energy intake and expenditure; continuous caloric restriction on a heart-healthy diet (CR) aligned with current United States (US) dietary recommendations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> versus our calorie-restricted IF-P diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, in forty-one individuals with overweight or obesity, over an 8-week intervention. We hypothesize an IF-P diet may favorably influence the GM and metabolome to a greater extent than a calorie-matched CR alone. This exploratory investigation utilizes data and samples from a randomized controlled trial (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT04327141">NCT04327141</ext-link>) that compares the effects of the CR versus IF-P diet on anthropometric and cardiometabolic outcomes, as previously published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. As an additional analysis, we select &#8220;high&#8221; and &#8220;low&#8221; responders based on relative weight loss (WL) for a subgroup examination of the IF-P diet to better elucidate potential differential responses to intermittent fasting and protein pacing. Of special note, one individual lost 15% of their initial body weight over the 8-week intervention; this individual is followed longitudinally for a year to explore the dynamics of their GM and fecal metabolome. Novel findings from the current study shows an IF-P regimen results in improved gut symptomatology, a more pronounced community shift, and greater divergence of the gut microbiome, including microbial families and genera, such as <italic toggle="yes">Christensenellaceae</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Rikenellaceae</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Marvinbryantia</italic>, associated with favorable metabolic profiles, compared to CR. Furthermore, IF-P significantly increases cytokines linked to lipolysis, weight loss, inflammation, and immune response. These findings shed light on the differential effects of IF-P as a promising dietary intervention for obesity management and microbiotic and metabolic health.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Intermittent fasting - protein pacing (IF-P) significantly influences gut microbiome (GM) dynamics compared to calorie restriction (CR)</title><p id="Par5">We compared an IF-P vs. a CR per-protocol dietary intervention (matched for total energy intake and expenditure) over eight weeks to compare changes in weight, cardiometabolic outcomes, and the GM in men and women with overweight/obesity (IF-P: <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;21; CR: <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;20).

The primary outcomes of dietary intake, body weight and composition responses, cardiometabolic outcomes, and hunger ratings after both dietary interventions are provided in our companion paper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Briefly, after a one-week run-in period consuming their usual dietary intake (baseline diet), with no differences between groups at baseline for any dietary intake variable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, both dietary interventions significantly reduced total fat, carbohydrate, sodium, sugar, and energy intake by approximately 40% (~1000&#8201;kcals/day) from baseline levels (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>; Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). By design, IF-P increased protein intake greater than CR during the intervention. The IF-P regimen consisted of 35% carbohydrate, 30% fat, and 35% protein for five to six days per week and a weekly extended modified fasting period (36&#8211;60&#8201;h) consisting of 350&#8211;550&#8201;kcals per day using randomization, as detailed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

While it might be expected that a significant reduction in calorie intake could influence gut microbial colonization, our findings indicate that this reduction did not reach statistical significance within the timeframe of our study. This result contrasts with previous research that imposed more substantial energy restriction, such as a four-week regimen of ~800&#8201;kcal/day in participants with overweight/obesity, where overall gut microbial colonization notably decreased<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.

Moreover, there were no significant differences between the two dietary intervention groups over time (interaction effect, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;0.051).

In relation to community composition, much of the intervention variance could be attributed to individual response upon testing nested permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA; <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#8201;=&#8201;0.749, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.001; Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>), showcasing the highly individualistic landscape of the human GM in response to dietary intervention. However, a significant 1.8% of the variance was accounted for by the group&#8201;&#215;&#8201;time interaction (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.001).

Notably, the changes observed at the four-week mark were more pronounced compared to those at eight weeks. These early alterations may signify an initial adaptation phase during which microbial populations respond to the modified substrate availability and nutrient composition, suggesting a degree of community resilience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Increases were sustained to the third fecal collection for the family <italic toggle="yes">Christensenellaceae</italic> and the genera <italic toggle="yes">Incertae Sedis</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">Ruminococcaceae</italic> family), <italic toggle="yes">Christensenellaceae R-7 group</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">UBA1819</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">Ruminococcaceae</italic> family) (effect size&#8201;&gt;&#8201;2.0). <italic toggle="yes">Christensenellaceae</italic> is well regarded as a marker of a lean (anti-obesity) phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and is associated with higher protein intake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

In addition, IF-P increased <italic toggle="yes">Ruminococcaceae</italic>, which has been noted to have an increased proteolytic and lipolytic capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. This shift in IF-P participants likely represents a change in GM substrate fermentation preferences as the diet regimen (relative protein and carbohydrate) and energy restriction is expected to increase the proteolytic: saccharolytic potential ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In contrast, all taxa that decreased in IF-P participants were butyrate producers. These included the family <italic toggle="yes">Butyricicoccaceae</italic> and several genera such as <italic toggle="yes">Butyricicoccus</italic> (week four), <italic toggle="yes">Eubacterium ventriosum group</italic> (weeks four and eight), and <italic toggle="yes">Agathobacter</italic> (week four) (effect size&#8201;&lt;&#8201;&#8722;2.0).

Others, such as the mucosa-associated <italic toggle="yes">Butyricicoccus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Erysipelotricaceae</italic> UCG-003, have been positively correlated with insulin resistance and speculated to contribute to impaired glycolipid metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Despite these changes in GM composition and increased fiber intake (+30% vs. baseline) of the IF-P participants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, we did not detect a significant shift in the abundance of the principal fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), acetate, propionate, butyrate, or valerate, as assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC&#8211;MS) (LME, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;0.470; Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1c</xref>; Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Several factors likely contribute to this finding. For example, the distinct physical-chemical properties of fiber sources between IF-P and CR are inherently different. Participants adhering to the IF-P diet consumed most of their dietary fiber as liquid meal replacements (shakes) that are rich in non-digestible, oligosaccharide dietary-resistant starch 5 (RS5). In contrast, subjects on the CR regimen consumed their fiber from whole food sources such as vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. These fiber sources provided a mixture of soluble and insoluble fibers and a more complex fiber profile than IF-P participants. Moreover, even similar fiber profiles may function differently due to differences in food matrices and/or food preparation (cooking, raw consumption, etc.). Also of relevance is the timing of their fiber consumption. IF-P participants&#8217; fiber intake was concentrated in fiber-rich shakes, offering immediate availability of fiber to the GI tract. In contrast, CR participants consumed fiber through whole foods, leading to a slower digestion and absorption process influenced by individual digestive transit times and enzymatic profiles. Interestingly, our results parallel recent work where participants more than doubled their fiber intake without affecting fecal SCFAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The disparate findings may be due to the type of dietary-resistant starch (RS) as a component of the nutrition regimen. In the current study, RS5 was included in the meal replacement shakes (eight grams/shake, two shakes/day, 16&#8201;g/day total). Prior research supports resistant starch intakes of &gt;20&#8201;g/day favorably modulate SCFA production, primarily butyrate, over four to 12-week interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Moreover, this lack of response in fecal SCFAs in both groups may have been further compounded by the significant reduction in energy intake in both groups, where the epithelia of the GI tract may have absorbed any potential increase in SCFAs from the dietary shift. It is worth noting that stool analysis may not be the most reliable biological surrogate for capturing SCFA flux over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the changes in nutrient quality, timing, ratios, and the observed shift toward proteolytic activity suggest that the luminal matrix of digesta in the IF-P group impacted substrate availability for GM. This effect appears to be an influencing force in driving the observed beneficial shifts in microbial communities, such as <italic toggle="yes">Christensenellaceae</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Incertae Sedis</italic>, as well as improvements in GI symptomatology in IF-P compared to CR. These results underscore the complexity of dietary influences on GM and highlight the need for further research to explore the impact of liquid meal replacements versus whole food sources on GM changes and SCFA status.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>IF-P modulates circulating cytokines and gut microbiome taxa compared to CR</title><p id="Par9">Caloric restriction and WL have been well known to positively influence inflammatory cytokine expression, with GM now emerging as an important modulator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

Several other investigators have noted the increase in acetylcarnitine via fasting protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. This increase is consistent with free fatty acid mobilization and increased transportation of these fatty acids via carnitine acylation into the mitochondria for fatty acid oxidation. These results would also be consistent with the expected ketogenesis, although not documented in our study, but noted by similar fasting interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Relatedly, malonic acid, a naturally occurring organic acid, is a key regulatory molecule in fatty acid synthesis via its conversion to acetoacetate; hence, our results may reflect this increased synthesis in response to the mobilization and oxidation of fatty acids occurring during fasting. Other metabolites that decreased with IF-P include several sugar alcohols (myoinositol, dulcitol, and xylitol). Dulcitol (galactitol) is a sugar alcohol derived from galactose. It is possible that during fasting, levels of dulcitol decrease as glucose (initially) and free fatty acids (after 24&#8211;36&#8201;h of fasting) are preferentially utilized as energy substrates. One amino acid (asparagine) and one amino acid analog (N-acetylglutamine, associated with consumption of a Mediterranean diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>) also decreased with IF-P relative to CR. Finally, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid significantly decreased with IF-P. This metabolite is formed during the metabolism of flavonoids, as it is found abundantly in fruits, vegetables, and some spices. At the cellular level, this hydroxybenzoic acid functions as a cell signaling agent and has been speculated as a potentially protective molecule in various cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. It is unclear whether this metabolite decreased due to either dietary intake or metabolic processes related to high-protein intake or the fasting protocol. Collectively, the metabolic responses to these dietary regimens reflect the interrelationships of several anabolic and catabolic physiologic responses to three key components of these interventions: (a) the WL process itself, (b) changes in amount (and type) of macronutrient distribution (i.e., meal replacement shakes vs. whole food diet approach; higher vs. normal protein intakes), and (c) the adherence to fasting (IF-P only).</p><p id="Par13">To determine the significantly impacted pathways of the dietary interventions, we grouped participant samples according to baseline or intervention period (weeks four and eight), with IF-P and CR assessed separately.

Notably, the glycine, serine, and threonine pathway has recently been found in preclinical models to play a pivotal role in longevity and related life-sustaining mechanisms independent of diet, though heavily impacted by fasting time and caloric restriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.

In our analysis, this pathway was significant in both diet groups and is biochemically and topologically related to the additionally captured amino acid pathway, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, as well as the energy-releasing pathway, the citrate cycle (TCA cycle). Notably, in the CR group, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, are important for neurotransmitter production and reported to be suppressed (tryptophan) in obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.

Together, these integrated findings from the group comparisons (IF-P vs. CR), high vs. low responders, and the case study, suggest that the remodeling of the gut microbiome through sustained weight loss on an IF-P regimen not only alters the microbial composition but also influences key metabolic pathways and output, reflective of fat mobilization and metabolic improvement.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par24">Our study demonstrates distinct effects of IF-P on gut symptomatology and microbiome, as well as circulating metabolites compared to continuous CR. We observed significant changes in the GM response to both interventions; however, the IF-P group exhibited a more pronounced community shift and greater divergence from baseline (i.e., intra-individual Bray-Curtis dissimilarities). This shift was characterized by increased specific microbial families and genera, such as <italic toggle="yes">Christensenellaceae</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Rikenellaceae</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Marvinbryantia</italic>, associated with favorable metabolic profiles. Furthermore, IF-P significantly increased circulating cytokine concentrations of IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13. These cytokines have been linked to lipolysis, WL, inflammation, and immune response. The plasma metabolome analysis revealed distinct metabolite signatures in IF-P and CR groups, with the convergence of multiple metabolic pathways. These findings shed light on the differential effects of IF regimens, including IF-P as a promising dietary intervention for obesity management and microbiotic and metabolic health.</p><p id="Par25">While acknowledging individual contributions of WL, protein pacing, and IF, we propose that the beneficial shifts observed may be best characterized as the culmination of features inherent in our IF-P approach. For example, it is possible that microbial competition is leveraged during reduced and intermittent nutritional input periods, emphasizing nutrient composition and food matrix type (combination of whole food and meal replacements vs. primarily whole food), affecting available substrates for gut microbes. IF-P participants&#8217; fiber intake was concentrated in fiber-rich (RS5 type) shakes, offering immediate availability of fiber to the GI tract. In contrast, CR participants consumed fiber through whole foods, leading to a slower digestion and absorption process influenced by individual digestive transit times and enzymatic profiles. This nutritional environment may create ecological niches that support symbiont microbial communities. In this investigation, we provide support of such remodeling, with intentional fasting and increased relative protein (protein pacing) consumption well-validated to improve body composition and metabolism during weight loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Our results align with previous studies on CR, where greater relative protein intake was associated with an increased abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Christensenella</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>. This increase is likely a result of increased amino acid-derived metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. We also observed increased signatures of amino acid metabolism in the GM of IF-P participants, which may be attributed to increased nitrogen availability, prompting de novo amino acid biosynthesis. The liquid format of two of the daily meals and precise timing of high-quality protein consumption (Protein Pacing) in the IF-P regimen may have influenced these results, as amino acids play essential roles in microbial communities, acting as energy and nitrogen sources and essential nutrients for amino acid auxotrophs.</p><p id="Par26">In addition to the differences in nutrient composition, the IF-P group exhibited a profound reduction (33%) in visceral fat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This reduction is significant because visceral fat is highly correlated with GM. While the specific influence of GM on fat depots in our study remains unclear, the shift in cytokine profile and metabolic pathways suggests an interaction between GM and fat metabolism. Regarding GM-host interaction, we did not detect changes in gut permeability assaying LBP. However, correlations were found with cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 and microbes <italic toggle="yes">Colidextribacter</italic> (negative association) and <italic toggle="yes">Ruminoccus gauveauii group</italic> (positive association). These associations may reflect the direct impact of the dietary intervention, yet they also hint at a deeper crosstalk within the gut-immune axis. This crosstalk is known to play a pivotal role in modulating host inflammation and influencing adipose tissue signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the observed microbial shifts, including changes in populations of <italic toggle="yes">Christensenella</italic>, suggest a nuanced role for certain microbes in regulating metabolic health. Notably, certain strains of <italic toggle="yes">Christensenella</italic> have been implicated in the regulation of key metabolic markers, such as glycemia and leptin levels, and in promoting hepatic fat oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">Our findings also underscore that GM composition plays a role in WL responsiveness during IF-P interventions. Subgroup analysis based on WL responsiveness revealed significant differences in species composition at the taxonomic level. The High-responder group showed an increased abundance of certain bacteria associated with metabolic benefits and anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, the Low-responder group exhibited an increased abundance of butyrate-producing and nutritionally adaptive species (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">Eubacterium ventriosum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup> and <italic toggle="yes">Roseburia inulinivorans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>). Fecal metabolome analysis further highlighted differences between the two subgroups, with distinct metabolic signatures and enrichment in specific metabolic pathways. Notably, the High WL responders displayed enrichment of fecal metabolites involved in lipid metabolism. In contrast, Low responders were more prominent in pathways related to the metabolism of amino acids and peptides, including glycine, serine, and threonine, d-glutamine, and d-glutamate, as well as tyrosine metabolism and arginine biosynthesis. The latter metabolic signature has been reported in individuals with severe obesity undergoing high-protein, low-calorie diets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup>. As both High and Low WL responders were consuming the same diet, our results suggest differences in GM composition and metabolism, which could play a role in determining the success of an IF-P regimen. Though, as these enrichment analyses were performed in an exploratory manner, we acknowledge the need for a more systematic approach to validate these findings.</p><p id="Par28">Finally, we provide evidence of long-term GM stabilization from these changes by following one individual over 12 months. Dietary restriction is widely used to reduce fat mass and weight in individuals with or without obesity; however, weight regain after such periods presents a critical challenge, and the underlying homeostatic mechanisms remain largely elusive. Notably, keystone taxa that became more prominent over time were associated with anti-adipogenesis, improved insulin sensitivity, and reduced metabolic disease risk. The microbial shifts were accompanied by noticeable changes in the fecal metabolome, with shifts in various metabolites and chemical subclasses. Pathway analysis identified impacts on primary bile acid biosynthesis, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and other fat mobilization and metabolic improvement pathways. These shifts were accompanied by noticeable changes in the fecal metabolome, particularly in metabolites and chemical subclasses related to lipid metabolism, nucleotide turnover, and aromatic amino acid formation.</p><p id="Par29">Despite the valuable insights from our study on the complex interactions between intermittent fasting, higher protein intake using protein pacing, the GM, and circulating metabolites in obese individuals, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, our reliance on fecal samples to represent the GM may have overlooked potential microbial populations in the upper GI tract. Including samples from proximal regions in future studies would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the gut microbiome&#8217;s response to IF-P and CR. In addition, the sample size for our study was determined based on the primary outcomes related to body weight and composition from the parent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This sample size may have reduced statistical power and potentially amplified individual variability among participants. However, it is important to note that the smaller RCT design allowed for more precise control over diet and lifestyle factors, minimizing potential confounding influences on the study outcomes. Furthermore, the study&#8217;s duration was limited to eight weeks, which prevented potential insights into the differential long-term effects between the two interventions. However, we were able to extend the follow-up duration and conduct periodic assessments for a year in our case-study participant, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the sustainability of the observed changes and the potential for weight regain for IF-P. The current study compared a combination of whole food and supplements (shakes and bars; IF-P) versus primarily whole food (CR), which together with variations in protein and fiber content and type may have influenced the gut symptomatology and nutrient absorption between groups. Additionally, study participants self-reported dietary intake daily, although there was close monitoring of intake through the return of empty food packaging/containers of consumed food and daily monitoring by investigators and weekly meetings with a registered dietitian. Overall, knowledge gaps are present in this research, including how the microbiome is rebuilt after food reintroduction and how overall caloric restriction and specific macronutrients contribute to this process. However, considering the multifactorial nature of weight loss and metabolic health, our work represents an important precedent for future work. Future investigators should consider integrating these factors to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Additional research is warranted to characterize the metabolic signature of IF-P, the time relationship between these fasting periods, and the analysis of these metabolic changes. A strength of our High-Low-responder and case-study analyses is the hypothesis-driving nature of the findings, from which targeted microbiome and/or precision nutrition interventions can be designed and tested.</p><p id="Par30">In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into the complex interactions among intermittent fasting and protein pacing, the GM, and circulating metabolites in individuals with obesity. Specifically, intermittent fasting - protein pacing significantly reduces gut symptomatology and increases gut microbes associated with a lean phenotype (<italic toggle="yes">Christensenella</italic>) and circulating cytokines mediating total body weight and fat loss. These findings highlight the importance of personalized approaches in tailoring dietary interventions for optimal weight management and metabolic health outcomes. Further research is necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving these associations and to explore the therapeutic implications for developing personalized strategies in obesity management. Additionally, future studies should consider investigating microbial populations in upper GI sections and potential intestinal tissue remodeling to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the gut microbiome&#8217;s role in these interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="Par31">The protocol of the clinical trial was registered on March 6, 2020 (Clinicaltrials.gov; <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT04327141">NCT04327141</ext-link>), and the results of the primary analysis have been published previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

Plasma metabolites were scaled and normalized as described in the metabolome analysis. The inputs for MOFA model training comprised 53 taxa and 138 metabolites. The latent factors and feature loadings were extracted from the best-trained model with the built-in functions of MOFA2. After model fitting, the number of factors was estimated by requiring a minimum of 2% variance explained across all microbiome modalities.</p><p id="Par49">Integrating microbial taxa with the same filtration as stated above (at the genus level from 16S amplicon sequencing and species level from metagenomic sequencing) and cytokine data and fecal metabolomic data, respectively, was conducted with GFLASSO (R package: GFLASSO, v0.0.0.9000). This correlation-based network solution can handle multiple response variables for a given set of predictors (in this case: 1. cytokine abundances predicted by microbial taxa response; and 2. fecal metabolite response predicted by microbial taxa). Solution parsimony was determined by an unweighted (i.e., presence or absence of association by imposing a correlation threshold) network structure. The regularization and fusion parameters were determined from the smallest root mean squared error (RMSE) estimate via cross-validation, accounting for interdependencies among microbial features. The tested parameters encompassed all combinations between &#955; and &#947; with values ranging from 0 to 1 (inclusive) in step increments of 0.1. GFLASSO coefficient matrices were constructed using a threshold coefficient of &gt;0.02 to discern the strongest associative signals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par50">Gastrointestinal symptom scores were on the low end of the GSRS scale and not normally distributed; therefore, nonparametric statistical tests were applied. Symptom prevalence (number of scores&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;2) and moderate symptom prevalence (&#8805;4) for total, upper, and lower GI GSRS clusters were analyzed using contingency tables. Specifically, differences between IF-P and CR GI symptoms at baseline were compared using a Fisher&#8217;s Exact test, whereas baseline vs. weeks four and eight values were compared with McNemar&#8217;s test. Stool weight, BSS, fecal pH, plasma cytokines and LBP, and SCFAs were assessed for normality with Q-Q plots and Shapiro-Wilk tests and log-transformed where appropriate. These were then tested for time and interaction (group&#8201;&#215;&#8201;time) effects using linear-mixed effect (LME) models, with each participant included as a random effect.</p><p id="Par51">For analysis and visualization of the microbiome data, artifacts generated in QIIME2 were imported into the R environment (v4.2.2) using the phyloseq package (v1.42.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref></sup>. Before conducting downstream analyses, sequences were filtered to remove all non-bacterial sequences, including archaea, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. After assessing normality (Shapiro-Wilk&#8217;s tests), LME models were used to test the effect of time and the interaction of group and time with the covariates of age and sex with each participant included as a random effect on the alpha diversity metrics using the nLME package (v3.1.160). For beta diversity, a nested permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was conducted on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities using the Adonis test in the vegan package (v2.6.2) with 999 permutations. The PERMANOVA model incorporated the factors of time, individual, interaction (group&#8201;&#215;&#8201;time), and participant (nested factor). A permutation test for homogeneity in multivariate dispersion (PERMDISP) was conducted using the &#8216;betadisper&#8217; function in the vegan package to compare dispersion. To support the Adonis analysis, intra-individual differences were also compared between groups, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref></sup>, by calculating the within-subject distance for paired samples (baseline vs. weeks four and eight) and testing for group distances (Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Differential abundance analysis was performed using MaAsLin2 (v1.12.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. To detect changes in microbial features between groups over time, we built linear-mixed models that include group, time, and their interaction, with age and sex as covariates and the participant as a random factor. Before analysis, raw counts from the ASV table were filtered for any sequence not present five times in at least 30% of all samples. A significant p-value for the product term indicates that changes in microbial features differed over time between groups. The Benjamini&#8211;Hochberg (BH) procedure was used to correct for multiple testing at &#8804;0.10. To assess the correlation between changes in specific taxa and biomarkers over the eight-week intervention, Spearman correlation tests were performed.</p><p id="Par52">Univariate and multivariate analyses of plasma metabolites and metabolic ontology analysis were performed, and results were visualized using the MetaboAnalystR 5.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref></sup>. Human metabolomic data were mapped to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) human pathway library to analyze predicted states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref></sup>. The data were log<sub>10</sub>-transformed, and Pareto scaled to approximate normality before all analyses. A GLM was constructed with age, sex, and time as covariates to determine significantly affected metabolites by group intervention. Levene&#8217;s test was performed to detect significant homogeneity. The BH procedure was used to correct for multiple testing at &#8804;0.10. Fecal metabolomic analysis for the subgroup comparison was performed by assessing logFC values between groups with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test with BH adjustment. For pathway analysis, the impact was calculated using a hypergeometric test, while significance was determined using a test of relative betweenness centrality. Importantly, the BH procedure was not applied to pathway and enzyme enrichment analyses for the subgroup assessment since these analyses involve testing the significance of multiple related hypotheses rather than independent hypotheses, which is too conservative, resulting in false negative results.</p><p id="Par53">For MOFA, latent factors explaining &#8805;2.0% of model variance from the plasma metabolomic and amplicon microbiome data were used to perform Spearman correlations on anthropometric and nutritional data and compared between IF-P and CR groups using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. The highest beta coefficients (&gt;0.3) detected from GFLASSO models were further assessed by performing Spearman correlations of select microbial features with the response variables (i.e., cytokines and fecal metabolites).
